The Shipset#.LFD file used by TIE95 holds the data used by the Tech Room. Many
craft that are in the game are not shown in Tech Room, and it is simple to add
them to the list. The file holds the OPT model name and the strings displayed.

Note: The Shipset files do not include the seven player craft (TIE through MIS)
as these strings are defined in their respective SHIP#.LFD files.

Shipset LFD Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
SHORT	2	signed Int16

The Shipset LFD only has two data blocks; a completely unneccessary RMAP block,
and the TEXT block.  It may be possible that more than one section was intended
for these files at one point, hence the use of RMAP.

--
0x00	Rmap
0x20	ShipsetText
--

struct ShipsetText
{
	0x00	Header
	0x10	SHORT	NumberOfShips
	0x12	String[NumberOfShips]
			SubString[0]	Name
			SubString[1]	OptFilename
			SubString[2]	Line1
			SubString[3]	Line2
			SubString[4]	Line3
			SubString[5]	Line4
}

Structure Detail

Just the Text is of real importance, the Rmap could've been excluded entirely.

Text.Header.Name is the filename minus extension.

There are six SubStrings used in the file, but only three types. The first one
is the craft name and abbreviation that is displayed when the craft is selected
in the Tech Room. The second SubString tells the application which OPT model to
display. The last four SubStrings are the text that are displayed below the
model. Typical values for these substrings are top speed, armaments, followed
by shields and hull strengths. The Line# substrings can be whatever you desire,
only the OptFilename has any sort of importance to it.

Refer to Resource_TEXT.txt for more detailed TEXT information.

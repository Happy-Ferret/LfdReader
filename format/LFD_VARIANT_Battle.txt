Battle LFD Overview

The Battle LFD is used by TIE Fighter to define the mission files used in a
given battle, as well as the descriptions and system image see in the Battle
Selection screen.  There is one LFD file for each battle and can be found in
the RESOURCE/ directory

=====
Battle LFD Structure

The following values are used through this and all of my file definitions
unless otherwise specified:
NAME	LENGTH	DESC
----	------	----
SHORT	2	signed Int16

The Battle LFD variant contains three resources; RMAP, TEXT, and DELT.

--
0x00	Rmap
0x30	BattleText
	Delt

struct BattleText
{
	0x00	Header
	0x10	SHORT	NumberOfStrings
	0x12	String	Names
			SubString[0]	Battle
			Substring[1]	Cutscene
		String	Titles
			SubString[0]	Battle1
			SubString[1]	Battle2
			SubString[2]	Cutscene1
			SubgString[3]	CutScene2

Structure Details

-- Rmap --

The file begins with the RMAP resource type with a Length of 0x20 for the
two sub-sections, followed by the two subsequent headers.  SubHeader[0] is
for the TEXT, SubHeader[1] is the DELT. Refer to Resource_RMAP.txt for more
detailed RMAP information.

-- Text --

Text.Header.Name in this resource is the filename, minus extension.
Text.NumberOfStrings in this resource evaluates to NumberOfMissions + 4.

The Name and Title Strings are those shown in the Battle Selection screen.
There are effectively six lines of text that can be used here.

Image text is part text, part data stored in text form. The purpose of
having Delt.Name here is unknown, since there's only one DELT data block
to get the image from. It may be feasible to load a DELT resource defined in
another file loaded in memory. SystemName is the string that displays when
the system image has zoomed in on the galaxy map. The Frame value controls the
frame that appears on the galaxy map before zooming and is of the form:
Top + " " + Height + " " + Left + " " + Width, where the values are stored as
strings, not numerals (so a 120x90 frame at (20,30) SubString is
"30 90 20 120/0").

The next string is the list of filenames without extensions for all missions
involved in the battle.  The Descriptions follow, which are shown in the
Combat Chamber when playing historical battles after completion in the
campaign. There is only one SubString for each Description.

-- Delt --

The image data located in the DELT resource is the system image that is shown
on the galaxy map after being zoomed in. The first row (0) itself is hidden
and is not seen in-game, due to the enlarged image TOP being set to just within
the frame of the galaxy map. That value is controlled within a seperate file.
For the purposes of this file, simply treat the first row as dead space. 

For information regarding the DELT structure, refer to Resource_DELT.txt.
